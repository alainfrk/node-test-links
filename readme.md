# node-test-links

Tool to test links availability on web pages

1. **npm install** for installing Puppeteer
2. **npm run dev** to run the script
3. Input (or copy/paste) the url of the starting route of the website you want to test

**Note :** For local testing, using the VScode extension "Live Server" can cause issues. Works fine with [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
